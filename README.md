# wordpress-exam-preparation

This is a WordPress/PHP project that I have build together with the students of SoftUni for exam preparation.

It contents a custom WordPress theme and a custom WordPress plugin for crating a jobs board website.

The custom theme has a page template displaying all the jobs

We have a plugin that takes care of creating the custom post type.

Steps to install:

- clone the project
- create a database locally
- upload the database
- create your local wp-config.php file
